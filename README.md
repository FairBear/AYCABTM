This plugin allows you to have your characters to randomly choose an outfit inside the `FashionSense` folder that must be found
in the `Koikatu\UserData` folder.
This happens at the beginning of each day and
whenever they enter one of the [specific places](https://github.com/FairBear/AYCABTM/wiki/Locations).
